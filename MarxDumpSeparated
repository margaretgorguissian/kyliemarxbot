["MANIFESTO ", "OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY A spectre ", "is haunting Europe -- the spectre ", "of Communism. All the Powers of ", "old Europe have entered into a ", "holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: ", "Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot, ", "French Radicals and German police-spies. Where ", "is the party in opposition that ", "has not been decried as Communistic ", "by its opponents in power? Where ", "the Opposition that has not hurled ", "back the branding reproach of Communism, ", "against the more advanced opposition parties, ", "as well as against its reactionary ", "adversaries?

", "I. BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANS The history ", "of all hitherto existing societies is ", "the history of class struggles.

In the earlier ", "epochs of history, we find almost ", "everywhere a complicated arrangement of society ", "into various orders, a manifold gradation ", "of social rank. In ancient Rome ", "we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; ", "in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, ", "vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in ", "almost all of these classes, again, ", "subordinate gradations.
