This project made heavy use of the [Make America Tweet Again](http://joedevelops.com/2016/07/30/make-america-tweet-again-part-1/) tutorial
from JoeDevelops. This is a fun project in order to teach myself elements of
Python and to familiarize myself with aspects of the Twitter API. Through this
project, I also learned about text generation and data storage methods.  
  
### Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to combine the tweets of Kylie Jenner with the 
texts of Karl Marx, and to have those combinations be tweeted automatically 
from a special twitter account with the handle @KylieMarxBot.  

### Method
* Tweets from @KylieJenner were accessed through Tweepy
